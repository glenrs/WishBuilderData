The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia contains data for 923 cell lines that have been profiled using high-throughput, genomic and transcriptomic technologies. This database also contains treatment-response values for 24 drugs. Researchers can use these data to identify cell lines that respond (or not) to particular chemotherapy treatments and derive insights about molecular drivers of these responses.

Comment(s): The expression data were generated using Illumina-based RNA-Sequencing and processed using the kallisto software. We summarized the data at the gene level by calculating the sum of expression across all transcripts for a given gene. We mapped these values to HUGO gene symbols.

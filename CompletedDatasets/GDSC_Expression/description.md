The purpose of this dataset is to help researchers to "identify molecular features of cancers that predict response to anti-cancer drugs." It contains genomic (mutation and copy-number variation) data and gene-expression data, as well as drug-response data for ?? cell lines. This dataset results from "a collaboration between the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (UK) and the Center for Molecular Therapeutics, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center (USA). This work is funded by the Wellcome Trust." We used the version of the data that was generated on July 4, 2016.

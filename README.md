Data for WishBuilder

# Purpose
WishBuilder is an open source project that provides biology-related datasets to Geney, a service that makes the data easily to filter and query for research. WishBuilder allows users to submit code which gathers and reformats data pulled from public Web servers into a consistent format described on the project wiki.

WishBuilderData manages data produced by glenrs before it is ready to be committed to WishBuilder.

# WishbuilderData
Data for [WishBuilder](https://github.com/srp33/WishBuilder)

# Purpose
[WishBuilder](https://github.com/srp33/WishBuilder) is an open source project that provides biology-related datasets to [Geney](https://github.com/srp33/Geney), a service that makes the data easily to filter and query for research. [WishBuilder](https://github.com/srp33/WishBuilder) allows users to submit code which gathers and reformats data pulled from public Web servers into a consistent format described on the project wiki.

WishBuilderData manages data produced by glenrs before it is ready to be committed to [WishBuilder](https://github.com/srp33/WishBuilder).
